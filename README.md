## Farnsdocs: Documentation format and verification

High-quality documentation is extremely useful, but maintaining it is often a pain. We aim to create a tool to facilitate easy creation and maintenance of API documentation.

### Goals

 - As a client engineer, I want to be able to document an API and keep it up to date
 - The server engineers want to be able to test their implementations
 - The documentation should be as close to the code as possible, it should live in the same repository (like specs)
   - Branches, reviews, and merges are the appropriate way to update the docs
   - Experimental drafts should just live on branches and never get merged into master
 - Specification alone is not enough, there needs to be room for discussion
